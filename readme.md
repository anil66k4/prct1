# Salary Prediction Web Application Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This is a prototype web application that predicts salaries using a custom-trained machine learning regression model. The application allows users to input personal and professional details to receive real-time salary estimates.

## Key Features
- Interactive web interface for salary prediction
- Machine learning model for personalized salary estimates
- Real-time prediction based on user-provided inputs
- Local host deployment

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask (Web Framework)
- Machine Learning Regression Algorithm
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend)

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python Package Manager)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/anil66k4/prct1.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open in browser
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Input Features
The model considers the following inputs:
- Work Experience
- Age
- Geographic Location

## Model Details
- Type: Regression Model
- Purpose: Salary Prediction
- Training: Custom-trained on selected dataset

## Limitations
- Prototype stage
- Local host deployment only
- Predictions are estimates, not guaranteed values

## Future Improvements
- Expand input features
- Improve model accuracy
- Deploy to cloud platform
- Improve data quality 
- Model training on large dataset
- Add more sophisticated machine learning techniques
